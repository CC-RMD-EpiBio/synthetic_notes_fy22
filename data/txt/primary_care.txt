Subjective:
Mr. Jones is a 58-year-old male with history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, depression, and lumbar radiculopathy who presents for routine follow up. 

Diabetes: With regards to his diabetes, his morning fingerstick glucoses have been 160-200. He has been loosely monitoring his diet to avoid high-carb foods, but he admits eating snack foods daily. He needs diabetic eye exam and foot exam today. Ongoing intermittent tingling, burning in his lower extremities bilaterally relieved with gabapentin. He previously obtained his diabetic eye exam at his optometrist, but he does not have an appointment scheduled soon. 

Hypertension: Home blood pressures have been 140s-150s/90s. He continues lisinopril 20 mg daily and HCTZ 25 mg daily. No headaches, chest pains, or shortness of breath. Electrolytes within normal limits six months ago. Prior polysomnography without signs of sleep apnea. 

Hyperlipidemia: ASCVD risk 14.5%. He continues atorvastatin 40 gm daily without side effects. 

Obesity: BMI 38 without significant change in weight (280 lbs) since last appointment. His back pain, discussed below, continues to limit his ability to exercise. 

Depression: He admits to feeling down lately, with little interest or pleasure in doing things he once enjoyed, like biking with his kids. He also reports difficulty sleeping at night and difficulty concentrating. No suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation. He continues on sertraline 150 mg daily. Describes his wife as being supportive, but unable to help. He has not tried therapy in the past. Exercise is limited due to pain (below). 

Lumbar radiculopathy: He continues to note bilateral back pain that radiates down both legs, right greater than left, that varies from 4/10 at baseline to 10/10 at worst. No bowel or bladder incontinence. No weakness or numbness in his legs. No fevers or chills. Prior X ray with severe degenerative disc disease, MRI with right-sided L5-6 radiculopathy. Prior physical therapy with some temporary benefit. Prior neurosurgical evaluation didn’t recommend surgery. Ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily provides some relief, but his pain still prevents him from exercising. He is unable to perform many of the tasks required in his job as a custodian (bending and lifting objects, standing for long periods), and he is considering early retirement or applying for disability due to his pain. No interference with household tasks.
